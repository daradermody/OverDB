# OverDB client

## Project structure

OverDB's frontend uses the following technologies:

- Typescript
- React
- Material UI
- React Router
- esbuild
- Apollo Client

Static files (HTML, favicon, etc.) are stored in `public` and Typescript is stored under `src`. During a build, they are moved into `build`.

A dev server is provided by the `scripts/devServer.js` script, which uses `esbuild.serve` underneath, while the production server is deployed just by pushing the static assets to AWS S3 and delivering using CloudFront.

## Interacting with the backend

GraphQL is used to interact with the backend for all but login. Query-specific Apollo hooks are generated by defining the query using `gql` in the file it's used and by running `yarn graphql-type-gen`. See [Watchlist.tsx](./src/watchlist/Watchlist.tsx) as an example.
